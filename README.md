# Scribus-batch-7-families-maker
Python script using the Scribus API to perform a batch processing of 42 cards

This project was done for a french dietician who wanted
to use a 7 families game on nutrition as an educational medium.

It might be useful as an exemple to people who want to perform batch operations with Scribus,
even though I found the API very well documented and straightforward on itself.


The background folder is supposed to contain the image files for each card.

The families folder contains the description of each family

The text folder contains the detailed description for each card.

And finally, the most interesting folder is python_functions, which is a package for the main function where most
of the stuff happens.
